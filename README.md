# AI Voice Interview Platform

## Overview

Developed an AI-powered interview platform in **Python** designed to simulate technical interviews based on uploaded resumes. The application parses resumes (in **PDF format**) to extract relevant information and utilizes machine learning techniques to dynamically generate personalized interview questions. The platform features an intuitive **Streamlit** user interface that allows users to select their desired job role (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, React Developer, Node.js Developer, ML Engineer) and upload their resumes to tailor the interview experience.

### Key Features:

- **Resume Parsing**: 
  - Users can upload resumes, which are parsed using **PyPDF2** to extract textual content. The extracted data is processed to generate relevant interview questions for the selected job role.
  
- **AI Interview Simulation**:
  - Job-specific interview questions are generated by analyzing the user's resume. Custom logic for each job role ensures that the interview questions are relevant and challenging.
  
- **User Interface**: 
  - Built using **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive, responsive interface that makes the process of uploading resumes, selecting job roles, and starting mock interviews seamless.
  
- **Data Processing**: 
  - Utilized **NumPy** and **Pandas** to process and manipulate the extracted resume data, ensuring that the platform can efficiently generate interview questions based on the parsed content.
  
- **Voice Interaction (Future Implementation)**: 
  - The platform is designed to integrate **Gemini API** for voice-based interactions, enabling users to engage in full, AI-powered voice interviews.

### Technologies Used:

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Streamlit, PyPDF2, NumPy, Pandas
- **APIs & Tools**: Gemini API, AI/ML Algorithms for question generation, Resume Parsing
- **Deployment**: Render (for hosting)

### Future Enhancements:
- Voice-based AI interviews powered by **Gemini API**, making the interview process more interactive.
- Expand job roles and interview complexity based on user feedback.
